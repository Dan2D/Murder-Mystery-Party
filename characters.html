                        <p>You are one of the top action stars of the times.... and you have a blatant speech impediment, though this fact is generally unknown. 
                            (This is essential to the plot. It can be a lisp, stutter, squeaky or nasally voice or any kind of voice pattern out of the ordinary)
                            Though, fate has been kind to you and handed you a part to play in the age of silent movies.
                            As a result of your attempts to hide your speech impediment oustide the stage, you've become regarded as aloof and mysterious, which has only added to your fame.
                            Starring in silent movies such as Times and Seasons, Destiny takes a Hand, and Flying Aces, Matt Montgomery became synonymous with action and heroism.
                            When the Great War came, you were among the recruits who were called upon to fight for this country. Even though your movie career was put on hold, news spread and your fame boomed.
                            You were having an affair with up and coming starlet Betty Sue Wilson, until McCutcheon threatened to end her career unless you cut if off.
                            McCutcheon was jealous of your relationship with Betty Sue and intervened, this left you seething mad.  </p>

                        <p>You are the daughter of Irish Immigrants whose love of entertainment drove her into the starlight.
                            A love of song and dance was instilled in you by your musical Father.
                            At a young age you started out entertaining on the streets, and eventually you saved enough money for acting lessons.
                            Those acting lessons paid off and you landed a gig in New York where you started making films.
                            Eventually you grew too big even for New York and ventured to Hollywood in search of greater fame.

                            You've got close ties to Matt Montgomery, as you've been paired with him as the leading lady multiple times
                             in the past and have had major success as a result.
