      <p>The year is 1927. The Great War ended over 8 years ago, and despite a small depression, the post war economy
        has been booming. The dreadful events of 1919, by that I mean Prohibition, is now in full swing, prohibiting
        any kind of liquor or booze, though this doesn't mean people have stopped drinking. Quite the opposite really!
        Calving Coolidge, or Silent-Cal as he's known, is President of the United States along with his co-pres Charles
        G. Dawes. <br><br>
        Vaudeville (...look it up) is still king, and Radio is prince, but Movies
        are becoming a national sensation of their own. The silver screens have yet to find their voice, however New
        York's Warner Theater had just shown a "talking picture" titled Don Juan!
        Can you imagine!?
        <br><br>
        As I'm sure you've heard by now, Arthur J. McCutcheon is dead, beat down in his own office on the night of
        August the 2nd, 1927.Leiutenant Leonard Collins of the Los Angeles Police department was put in charge of the
        case.
        The murder occurred somewhere between 7:00pm (when McCutcheon entered the studio) and
        9:00pm (when Irma Meyers discovered the body). It seems McCutcheon had died from a severe blow to the head.
        When police
        arrived McCutcheon was found on his casting couch in his sleeping gown,his office was full of smoke and
        some charred remains of blueprints were seen stoking the fireplace. Other notable items found in the office
        were
        a string of pearls, a prop dagger and a spilled whiskey glass, along with the charred blueprint remains.
        <br><br>
        But enough with the depressing, or depending on your viewpoint... exciting news! Tonight is the night!
        The Palms is throwing a party in memorium of Arthur J. McCutceon and lucky you, you're invited! Nevermind
        the fact your invitation came from that copper Collins in charge of investigating the murder case. In fact
        you're a VIP!
        A special room at the back of the restaraunt has been reserved just for you and your friends to remember
        the gracious soul Arthur J McCutcheon was. How thoughtful....
        <br><br>
        <span> Try not to look as guilty as you all sound, I'll be waiting! <br>
