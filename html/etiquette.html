                    There are 11 supporting players in this murder mystery however the roles you’ll be playing are quite
                    different.
                    Most of you will be attempting to unearth the truth of Andrew J McCutcheon’s murder, while 1 or more of you,
                    who shall remain un-named...
                    will attempt to disguise that truth and escape the clutches of justice!
                    <br><br>
                    Each of you will take on the role of a character working in close relation to McCutcheon,
                    all of you are suspects in this most heinous of murders. The night will be sectioned into rounds,
                    during each round
                    clues will begin to be revealed which point you in the direction of the real murderer!
                    <br><br>
                    The object of this night of mystery is to bring the murder (or murderers...) to justice.
                    At some point during the night before the end of the 4th round, the murderer(s) will be told who

                    <br><br>

                <h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I've supplied summaries of your characters and the plot, but it would be beneficial to read
                        through the news clipping and your character backgrounds as welL!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DO NOT TURN PAST ANY PAGE THAT IS MARKED
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Game is sectioned into rounds and starts with Round 1.
                        Round 1 should start with introductions using the information avaialable to each character.
                        To begin a round, one player should reveal a clue about someone other than themselves.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two types of clues exist in this game.
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                A clue about someone other than yourself. <br>
                                Example "You saw Mary kissing John on the set last week, when Phil walked in the door
                                and Mary abruptly broke off the kiss."<br>
                                (You may divulge this type of clue at any point during the round)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A clue about yourself <br>
                                Example: "You own a fuzzy pink teddy bear. It is soft, cuddly and has a hidden pocket
                                in which you keep a diamond brooch." <br>
                                A clue about yourself does not need to be revealed unless someone else brings it up
                                first <br>
                                If this is the case you cannot lie about it, but you don't need to divulge the full
                                clue either, for instance you could leave out the part about the hidden pocket
                                or the diamond brooch.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Occasionally a clue will seem to come out of nowhere, this means that someone else has a clue
                        that refers to your clue. If this is the case take it
                        as a warning that the subject wil be coming up soon and you should prepare yourself to talk
                        about it and/or what to not divulge.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When answering questions it is your primary duty to try not to incriminate yourself, you can
                        avoid doing this by leaving out parts of the truth or trying
                        to change subjects, but one exception is that YOU MAY NOT LIE! <br><br>
                        Occasionally you may be asked a question that you don't have the answer to, you may reply with
                        the codephrase "That's a very good question." <br><br>
                        This should let the other players know that none of your clues so far give an answer to that
                        question. (You can't use this phrase for any other reason)
                        Some clues may be inside curly brackets {}, this means this info is something you'd know but
                        not necessarily volunteer to tell others.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After all the clues in the First Round are revealed the host will instruct you to turn to the
                        next page. <br>
                        After everyone has studied their new clues, the next Round may begin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the 4th Round the players have all the clues necessary to solve the murder. <br>
                        After discussing the evidence among themselves, each player should give an answer as to who
                        they think is the culprit(s) of the murder.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once everyone has given their answers the host will instruct the players to turn to the last
                        page in their booklet and read from the section marked
                        SOLUTION. <br>
                        Each player has a part of the solution marked 1 through 8 and should read their part in order.
                    </li>
