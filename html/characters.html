                            <p>You are one of the top action stars of the times.... and you have a blatant speech
                                impediment, though this fact is generally unknown.
                                (This is essential to the plot. It can be a lisp, stutter, squeaky or nasally voice or
                                any kind of voice pattern out of the ordinary)
                                Though, fate has been kind to you and handed you a part to play in the age of silent
                                movies.
                                As a result of your attempts to hide your speech impediment oustide the stage, you've
                                become regarded as aloof and mysterious, which has only added to your fame.
                                Starring in silent movies such as Times and Seasons, Destiny takes a Hand, and Flying
                                Aces, Matt Montgomery became synonymous with action and heroism.
                                When the Great War came, you were among the recruits who were called upon to fight for
                                this country. Even though your movie career was put on hold, news spread and your fame
                                boomed.
                                You were having an affair with up and coming starlet Betty Sue Wilson, until McCutcheon
                                threatened to end her career unless you cut if off.
                                McCutcheon was jealous of your relationship with Betty Sue and intervened, this left
                                you seething mad. </p>

                                <p>
                                    You grew up in Los Angeles, California and you were no stranger to the hustle lifestyle of the city. At a young age  you started a business
                                    selling wooden pallets you found in alleys throughout the city. You even collected groups of homeless men to work for you paying them a wage.
                                    You were becoming a upstanding and contributing member of society, but soon your business got busted. No matter, you made a good profit and moved
                                    on to the next big thing. In your teen years you learned how to ferment fruit and made alcoholic drinks to sell to underaged teens like yourself.
                                    One day you met some rather unsavory characters for a big deal. You had done well so far, even using recycled bottles and labels, but these men had 
                                    offered you a step into the big ring. You took the deal and made a fortune! However your new friends had lacked somewhat of a moral compass
                                    and some would say were a bad influence. They liked to gamble you see, and so, being their new business associate, you did too. And you were pretty good
                                    at it too! The rush it gave you was incredible. This gambling habit lead into drinking and eventually drugs. The drugs and alcohol hit you hard and almost cost you
                                    all of your savings. But you were still you, you still had your 'Dewits'...(I couldn't resist). In a last ditch attempt to save yourself, you sobered up and made a plan.
                                     You arranged a highstakes poker game through your old business associates. There would be one last score and you would be sure to win...
                                     You cheated of course, but what you won wasn't what you expected. You became the new head of a movie studio in Hollywood? Acme Studios. This new industry intrigued you.
                                     You decided to move to Hollywood and give this new role a go. You loved it, the lights, the sounds, the action! You eventually worked with a Scandinavian Director named
                                     Olaf Hendrikssen, who was a bit of a drinker and gambler himself. Unfortunately your old habits came through again. You and Olaf would go on crazy drug and alcohol fueled
                                     trips to Vegas. Some were a success, but most were a money pit. Your studio was doing well and you had just acquired the rights to this new movie called 'The Wizard of Oz'.
                                     When you were contacted by a man named McCutcheon. He said he had some information you would find quite... interesting. This bastard was blackmailing you! Somehow he knew about
                                     the dirty game of cards you played to win that studio and now he was holding it above your head. He not only stole the rights to your new movie, but he even stole a number of your
                                     star actors/actresses and even your good buddy Olaf! He let you keep the studio, but if anyone ever found out, you'd be in hot water. The kind that boils you alive...
                                     You needed to get something on the asshole or maybe it'd be easier if he just disappeared.

                            <p> You are an only child born out of wedlock in a messy affair with Arthur J McCutcheon
                                himself. Though as soon as he learned your mother, Dolores Simpson, was pregnant, he
                                kicked her to the curb and denied any involvement.
                                This made your mother understandably furious and she swore she'd have her revenge on
                                the man she once loved. Your mother cultivated her hatred of McCutcheon in you
                                and you readily took on her cause.
                                Your whole life has known one purpose, to take revenge upon your father that abandoned
                                you and
                                your family. In order to get close to Arthur you've taken on the persona of Betty Sue
                                Wilson and have been having a somewhat discreet affair with Matthew Montgomery.
                                Your "relationship" with Matt paid off and have recently secured employment at Superior
                                Studios as an up and coming actress, with Matt's help of course...
                                Matt is just tool in your scheme, you don't really care about him or his feelings.</p>

                            <p> You'rve had a love of the theater and movies ever since you can remember.
                                You hold cinema as a higher artform and relish the time you get to spend perfecting
                                your craft.
                                There are two other activities that hold just as much, if not more of your fixation....
                                drinking and gambling.
                                As you can imagine, this has not been good for your career, you've been fired from your
                                last 3 studios as a result of your more dubious habits.
                                Your gambling debts have pushed you to more drastic acts. In attempts to pay off your
                                debts you've been involved in an insurance fraud scheme with
                                Clyde Willoughby. Pretending to be drunk and forcing movies to go overbudget allowed
                                you and Clyde to skim money off the top. Although your activities
                                did not go unnoticed. Alice Chatterly found out about your schemes and has been
                                blackmailing you for information in return for her silence. Chatterly putting
                                the press on you has caused unwanted stress which has made you start drinking heavily.
                                Coming into work drunk has become a reality and eventually got you fired
                                from Superior Studios, but you kept coming back. Arthur allowed it, but on the day he
                                was murdered Arthur had fired you again... and this time you suspect he meant it.

                            <p>
                                Despite a rather meager earnings, you were the center of your parents world and they did there best to make you happy.
                                 A task they might have accomplished just a bit too well. You were happy...for a time, but soon you grew tired of your 
                                parent's constant offerings. You wanted more, or perhaps you just wanted something your parent's could never give you...
                                You grew up in, what you liked to refer to... a one horse town, the middle of nowhere, a veritable pit of existence.
                                 But still, you found ways of entertaining yourself.There were of course always men with nice things... things you wanted for yourself. 
                                 At a rather young age, you found you could get others to do what you wanted by putting on a little show and dance, making the men,
                                  and sometimes even women, go all dumb in the head. You quickly learned the art of seduction and gained a lot of experience, I mean... just a huge amount.
                                 You found yourself in a relationship with the governer and enjoyed all the lavish perks, but you craved something more. One day you saw one
                                 of those silent pictures and it just clicked. Hollywood! It was time to test your talents in the big pond. You moved to hollywood and after
                                 one or two practice runs, you found yourself at Superior Studios. You managed to charm some dupe named McCutcheon who owned the place and got a gig
                                 as the receptionist. But McCutcheon wasn't like the other blank faced buffoons you dealt with before, he was stubborn and a bit of a womanizer himself.
                                 Just as you thought you were making some headway into his giant piles of money and fame. Something happened...
                                 You made further advances and he suddenly became aggressive. He abused you and made it clear you were nothing but a distraction to him.
                                 A new starlet named Betty Sue Wilson caught his eye and you were old news. You've never been treated so terribly in all your years of seduction!
                                 You quit in a fit of rage and swore to have revenge on that peice of human filth. There were other powerful figures in this town, people who could help you
                                 exact your revenge...

                            <p>From a young age you found you were more mechanically inclined. Your father owned a
                                machine shop
                                and as a child you and your friends would tinker with random thingamajigs throughout
                                the day. Your father
                                saw you had a gift for the sciences and enrolled you in Philadelphia's highschool for
                                science, from which you graduated with high honors.
                                You had dreams of joining the Army's Corps of Engineers, but the Army had other plans
                                and assigned you to the infantry.
                                At the battle of Argonne during the great war in 1917 you were injured whilst running
                                with your tail between your legs and were sent home with a medal.
                                Luckily only a few members from your squad actually know how you were discharged, it
                                embarasses you greatly.
                                After the war you went into radio and filed a few patents working for a company Videola
                                and made quite a bit of money. After some bad
                                investments you became discouraged, but when you were about to quit your received a
                                telegram for a job opportunity from none other than Arthur J. McCutcheon.
                                Once you started work for McCutcheon you found it was not the great opportunity he made
                                it sound. Any inventions you made were stolen by McCutcheon when he registered patents
                                in his own name!
                                You didn't see a dime of the riches he made off your inventions.
                                And to top it off, when you threatened to quit McCutcheon started blackmailing you!
                                Somehow he found out what really happened at Argonne and was threatening to spread the
                                story
                                unless you kept churning out inventions for him.
                                If McCutcheon wasn't bad enough already, the one girl you were interested in, Irma
                                Meyers, was romantically involved with the person whose caused all this mess in the
                                first place,
                                Arthur J. McCutcheon.
                                <br><br>
                                You're extremely shy around women, socially awkward, and prefer to spend your evenings
                                at home tinkering rather than going out and socializing.
                                Your favorite topic of conversation are your magnificent inventions of course.

                            <p>Growing up you came from a lowerclass family and at a young age had to learn to take
                                care of yourself. Your parents made
                                their money performing menial tasks for wealthier families, they were essentially
                                servants. This rough life
                                fostered a fire in you and you swore to yourself
                                that you would never make a living doing someone elses chores. Instead you started
                                hairdressing at a local salon and after rising up
                                the ranks you eventually landed at Rudolpho's a famous hair salon in Hollywood that
                                catered to only the biggest and brightest stars.
                                Through Rudolpho's you got your foot into the film industry and started acting.
                                It's there you met McCutcheon and started a rocky love affair. But those rose colored
                                glasses
                                broke soon after you noticed he had
                                wandering eyes for nearly any woman that walked onto his set, especially that Betty Sue
                                Wilson. This, coupled with the feeling that your affair
                                was cooling down and the thought that McCutcheon might break it off soon drove you mad
                                with Hysteria.
                                <br><br>
                                The history of your love life is a bit checkered to say the least. Several years ago
                                you found your lover
                                in bed with another woman and in a fit of rage
                                murdered him in cold blood. Luckily, the The studio you were working for at the time
                                covered up
                                the murder for you in an attempt to avoid any bad press.
                                <br><br>
                                McCutcheon seemed to take advantage of your relationship and had you fill into his
                                secretary position after the old one quit suddenly. Despite
                                not being paid for the extra work, you agreed to the position, as it seemed a useful
                                post to keep your eye on McCutcheon.

                            <p>You started out your career as a typist for the Burbank Sun, where you would transcribe
                                stories, but you really wanted to be where the action was. Crime, Murder, juicy
                                Gossip! That's where the real stories were at! During this time women weren't allowed
                                the position of reporter, so you came up with a plan and started writing stories
                                of your own under the monicher "Al Chapman". You managed to put out stories for 5
                                months before the city editor got a whiff of what was going on. After you were found
                                out, you were re-assigned to women's society, home, and garden pages. You ran with it
                                and turned the section on its head, writing some very controversial editorials.
                                Perhaps a bit too controversial for the Editor-in-Cheif who let you go after learning
                                of your methods. However he couldn't argue with the rise and subsequent fall in
                                popularity after firing you. You had an idea for a film focused column and went to the
                                LA Times to talk with the editor about your idea. You were given a 3-month trial
                                to test run your column, by the end of the 3 months you had a 10-year contract with the
                                LA Times, were syndicated in over 52 different news papers and were quickly becoming
                                a well known name in the news industry.
                                You've never married and prefer it that way, your job is your true love.

                                Alice Chatterly is a special guest in this little soirÃ©e and have access to more info
                                on the other "guests" than anyone else, probably even the detective...
                                You've been investigating Superior Studios, but have been blocked by Arthur J.
                                McCutcheon after painting a less that flattering image of him and the studio.
                                Although being the reporter that you are, you found a way to trade McCutcheon for the
                                information as long as you kept your mouth shut on some of Superiors little secrets...

                            <p>You started out in New York where after getting your CPA (Certified Public Accountant)
                                you got a job
                                with Underwriters National Professional which specialized in insuring the rich and
                                famous, as well
                                as some radio stations and theaters.However while you enjoyed working with numbers,
                                they just didn't
                                have the charm people do. After hearing about the roar that movies were causing around
                                the nation, you requested
                                a change to the Los Angeles branch. Now you get to work with numbers and be in close
                                proximity to the stars of Hollywood!
                                In fact you've worked with the stars at Superior Studios so much, you're considered
                                apart of the family... although you're technically
                                not employed by them.
                                <br><br>
                                You have checkered past of embezzling money from your employers, being the numbers wiz
                                you were, you thought it'd be a peice
                                of cake... it wasn't. You were sent to jail and did your time. While in prison you had
                                time to reflect, you realized
                                you were to haphazard with your previous scheme, this time it'll be different, this
                                time you won't get caught. After getting
                                out of prison you were even more emoldened to embezzle again. Youve come up with a
                                scheme to steal money from the
                                settlements McCutcheon's been earning through insurance on his over-budget and behind
                                schedule films. Olaf deliberately
                                slows down shoots with his drunken antics and then when the film is behind schedule and
                                the insurance film pays out its settlements
                                to McCutcheon. You and Olaf skim money off the top of the settlements and split it down
                                the middle. Olaf is using the money
                                to pay off his gambling debts.
                                <br><br>
                                If the subject of your prison time and embezzlement scheme comes up in conversation,
                                you may lie about it as necessary.
                                Lately you suspect McCutcheon was on to your scheme and to make matters worse Alice
                                Chatterly has somehow found out about it as well.
                                You've been paying her off to keep quiet, but you're not certain that will last.

                                <p>
                                    Born in what is held as the greatest state by those that live there, New Jersey, in a city that is regarded as a spiritual haven, Long Island, you had a pretty
                                    normal life growing up. That was until you hit the tender age of 8. You were walking down the shore when you decided to explore the underside of the docks.
                                    You found some pretty shells you were going to make into a necklace, but that was a necklace that would never be worn or even made. You happened upon an old man.
                                    He was carving some strange symbols into one of the jersey poles and speaking unintelligibley when he noticed you. You slowly backed away, frightened of the man's 
                                    squalid appearance. His eyes went wide at the sight of you and he beckoned you closer. You reluctantly moved closer. He called out your name and you froze. The man
                                    said there was something inside you like a glow or spark. He forcibly grabbed you and began muttering strange cryptic jersey-like sounds and began convulsing violently.
                                    The strange man died in front of you, or at least fell to the ground, you're not really sure you ran as fast as you could away from that place. Ever since that day you began
                                    to notice strange things happening to you. Voices coming from nowhere, ethereal images of animals and strangers appearing in flashes, and strange immediate emotions upon entering
                                    rooms. You started telling people about your experiences and while you were first brushed off, eventually they began to notice you had the Jersey Light. You became somewhat of a
                                    local celebrity performing seances and readings to those that would listen. One day a producer visited your Long Island town and was astonished by your Jersey Light. He offered
                                    to connect you with a friend of his and talked of future wealth and fame. This didn't interest you as much as the opportunity to offer your unique services to a wider range of people.
                                    You flew to Hollywood and met a man named Andrew J. McCutcheon. At first things were going great. You were offered a spritual medium radio show and the ratings were higher than expected.
                                    You never experienced anything in your life that brought you more joy than your show. But one day, you said something to McCutcheon that spooked him something fierce. He immediatley pulled your show and threatened to turn you into a laughing stock. The dispicable man
                                    was going to fabricate evidence to try and prove to people you were just a fraud. The Jersey Light couldn't be snuffed out so easily. You were going to get your show back no matter what...
