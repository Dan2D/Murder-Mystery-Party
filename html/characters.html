                            <p>You are one of the top action stars of the times.... and you have a blatant speech
                                impediment, though this fact is generally unknown.
                                (This is essential to the plot. It can be a lisp, stutter, squeaky or nasally voice or
                                any kind of voice pattern out of the ordinary)
                                Though, fate has been kind to you and handed you a part to play in the age of silent
                                movies.
                                As a result of your attempts to hide your speech impediment oustide the stage, you've
                                become regarded as aloof and mysterious, which has only added to your fame.
                                Starring in silent movies such as Times and Seasons, Destiny takes a Hand, and Flying
                                Aces, Matt Montgomery became synonymous with action and heroism.
                                When the Great War came, you were among the recruits who were called upon to fight for
                                this country. Even though your movie career was put on hold, news spread and your fame
                                boomed.
                                You were having an affair with up and coming starlet Betty Sue Wilson, until McCutcheon
                                threatened to end her career unless you cut if off.
                                McCutcheon was jealous of your relationship with Betty Sue and intervened, this left
                                you seething mad. </p>

                                A love of song and dance was instilled in you by your musical Father.
                                At a young age you started out entertaining on the streets, and eventually you saved
                                enough money for acting lessons.
                                Those acting lessons paid off and you landed a gig in New York where you started making
                                films.
                                Eventually you grew too big even for New York and ventured to Hollywood in search of

                                kicked her to the curb and denied any involvement.
                                This made your mother understandably furious and she swore she'd have her revenge on
                                the man she once loved. Your mother cultivated her hatred of McCutcheon in you
                                and you readily took on her cause.
                                Your whole life has known one purpose, to take revenge upon your father that abandoned
                                you and
                                your family. In order to get close to Arthur you've taken on the persona of Betty Sue
                                Wilson and have been having a somewhat discreet affair with Matthew Montgomery.
                                Your "relationship" with Matt paid off and have recently secured employment at Superior
                                Studios as an up and coming actress, with Matt's help of course...

                                drinking and gambling.
                                As you can imagine, this has not been good for your career, you've been fired from your
                                last 3 studios as a result of your more dubious habits.
                                Your gambling debts have pushed you to more drastic acts. In attempts to pay off your
                                debts you've been involved in an insurance fraud scheme with
                                Clyde Willoughby. Pretending to be drunk and forcing movies to go overbudget allowed
                                you and Clyde to skim money off the top. Although your activities
                                did not go unnoticed. Alice Chatterly found out about your schemes and has been

                                the press on you has caused unwanted stress which has made you start drinking heavily.
                                Coming into work drunk has become a reality and eventually got you fired
                                from Superior Studios, but you kept coming back. Arthur allowed it, but on the day he
                                was murdered Arthur had fired you again... and this time you suspect he meant it.

                            <p>From a young age you found you were more mechanically inclined. Your father owned a
                                machine shop
                                and as a child you and your friends would tinker with random thingamajigs throughout
                                the day. Your father
                                saw you had a gift for the sciences and enrolled you in Philadelphia's highschool for
                                science, from which you graduated with high honors.
                                You had dreams of joining the Army's Corps of Engineers, but the Army had other plans
                                and assigned you to the infantry.
                                At the battle of Argonne during the great war in 1917 you were injured whilst running
                                with your tail between your legs and were sent home with a medal.
                                Luckily only a few members from your squad actually know how you were discharged, it
                                embarasses you greatly.
                                After the war you went into radio and filed a few patents working for a company Videola
                                and made quite a bit of money. After some bad
                                investments you became discouraged, but when you were about to quit your received a
                                telegram for a job opportunity from none other than Arthur J. McCutcheon.
                                Once you started work for McCutcheon you found it was not the great opportunity he made
                                it sound. Any inventions you made were stolen by McCutcheon when he registered patents
                                in his own name!
                                You didn't see a dime of the riches he made off your inventions.
                                And to top it off, when you threatened to quit McCutcheon started blackmailing you!
                                Somehow he found out what really happened at Argonne and was threatening to spread the
                                story
                                unless you kept churning out inventions for him.
                                If McCutcheon wasn't bad enough already, the one girl you were interested in, Irma
                                Meyers, was romantically involved with the person whose caused all this mess in the
                                first place,
                                Arthur J. McCutcheon.
                                <br><br>
                                You're extremely shy around women, socially awkward, and prefer to spend your evenings
                                at home tinkering rather than going out and socializing.
                                Your favorite topic of conversation are your magnificent inventions of course.

                            <p>Growing up you came from a lowerclass family and at a young age had to learn to take
                                care of yourself. Your parents made
                                their money performing menial tasks for wealthier families, they were essentially
                                servants. This rough life
                                fostered a fire in you and you swore to yourself
                                that you would never make a living doing someone elses chores. Instead you started
                                hairdressing at a local salon and after rising up
                                the ranks you eventually landed at Rudolpho's a famous hair salon in Hollywood that
                                catered to only the biggest and brightest stars.
                                Through Rudolpho's you got your foot into the film industry and started acting.
                                It's there you met McCutcheon and started a rocky love affair. But those rose colored
                                glasses
                                broke soon after you noticed he had
                                wandering eyes for nearly any woman that walked onto his set, especially that Betty Sue
                                Wilson. This, coupled with the feeling that your affair
                                was cooling down and the thought that McCutcheon might break it off soon drove you mad
                                with Hysteria.
                                <br><br>
                                The history of your love life is a bit checkered to say the least. Several years ago
                                you found your lover
                                in bed with another woman and in a fit of rage
                                murdered him in cold blood. Luckily, the The studio you were working for at the time
                                covered up
                                the murder for you in an attempt to avoid any bad press.
                                <br><br>
                                McCutcheon seemed to take advantage of your relationship and had you fill into his
                                secretary position after the old one quit suddenly. Despite
                                not being paid for the extra work, you agreed to the position, as it seemed a useful
                                post to keep your eye on McCutcheon.

                            <p>You started out your career as a typist for the Burbank Sun, where you would transcribe
                                stories, but you really wanted to be where the action was. Crime, Murder, juicy
                                Gossip! That's where the real stories were at! During this time women weren't allowed
                                the position of reporter, so you came up with a plan and started writing stories
                                of your own under the monicher "Al Chapman". You managed to put out stories for 5
                                months before the city editor got a whiff of what was going on. After you were found
                                out, you were re-assigned to women's society, home, and garden pages. You ran with it
                                and turned the section on its head, writing some very controversial editorials.
                                Perhaps a bit too controversial for the Editor-in-Cheif who let you go after learning
                                of your methods. However he couldn't argue with the rise and subsequent fall in
                                popularity after firing you. You had an idea for a film focused column and went to the
                                LA Times to talk with the editor about your idea. You were given a 3-month trial
                                to test run your column, by the end of the 3 months you had a 10-year contract with the
                                LA Times, were syndicated in over 52 different news papers and were quickly becoming
                                a well known name in the news industry.
                                You've never married and prefer it that way, your job is your true love.

                                Although being the reporter that you are, you found a way to trade McCutcheon for the

                                they just didn't
                                have the charm people do. After hearing about the roar that movies were causing around
                                the nation, you requested
                                a change to the Los Angeles branch. Now you get to work with numbers and be in close
                                proximity to the stars of Hollywood!
                                In fact you've worked with the stars at Superior Studios so much, you're considered
                                apart of the family... although you're technically
                                not employed by them.
                                <br><br>
                                You have checkered past of embezzling money from your employers, being the numbers wiz
                                you were, you thought it'd be a peice
                                of cake... it wasn't. You were sent to jail and did your time. While in prison you had
                                time to reflect, you realized
                                you were to haphazard with your previous scheme, this time it'll be different, this
                                time you won't get caught. After getting
                                out of prison you were even more emoldened to embezzle again. Youve come up with a
                                scheme to steal money from the
                                settlements McCutcheon's been earning through insurance on his over-budget and behind
                                schedule films. Olaf deliberately
                                slows down shoots with his drunken antics and then when the film is behind schedule and
                                the insurance film pays out its settlements
                                to McCutcheon. You and Olaf skim money off the top of the settlements and split it down
                                the middle. Olaf is using the money
                                to pay off his gambling debts.
                                <br><br>
                                If the subject of your prison time and embezzlement scheme comes up in conversation,
                                you may lie about it as necessary.
                                Lately you suspect McCutcheon was on to your scheme and to make matters worse Alice
                                Chatterly has somehow found out about it as well.
                                You've been paying her off to keep quiet, but you're not certain that will last.
